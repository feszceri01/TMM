The Twelve Men's Morris is a strategy board game where two players play with 12 identical pieces each. It is believed that the game emerged from the Roman Empire over 2000 years ago. The exact origin of the game is not known as it is played to date in South Africa and some Asian countries. There are many variants and names of the game including "Qat" which means "line".  

Rules:
The rules of Qat/TMM that are as follows: 
	1   The board consists of three concentric squares joined by eight lines. The following is an example game developed in Python       using graphics.py. 
	2.	The two players first decide who goes first. The players start with an empty board and place their pieces (men) one by one       taking turns. Pieces can only be placed at vacant locations i.e. at the intersection of the lines and squares.
	3.	While placing the pieces, each player aims to make a line (a mill) while stopping the opponent from doing so.
	4.	If a player is able to make a straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) with three pieces placed consecutively,          he/she has made a mill and gets to remove one of the oppenent's pieces.
	5.	No player is allowed to remove an opponent's piece that is part of a mill (line).
	6.	Once both players have placed their 12 men (pieces), the game continues by moving the pieces (men) to adjacent vacant           spots in an effort to make new lines. 
	7.	Pieces can only be moved to adjacent vacant spots. If a player makes a new line, the above rule of taking out an o              pponent's piece that is not part of a mill applies.
	8.	Flying (jumping over multiple spots) is not allowed at any stage of the game.
	9.	Players are allowed to break their line (mill) and remake it (taking two moves to do so) and remove one of the opponent's       men.
	10.	The game ends when one of the players loses all pieces or is unable to move any piece i.e. all pieces are blocked.
